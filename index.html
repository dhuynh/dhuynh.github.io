                            <h3 align="left">Background</h3>

                            <p align="left"><b>Steam</b> is a digital storefront and platform for users to buy and play games on their personal computers (PC). It is currently the dominant platform for PC gamers with 13 million users online at any one time[1]. </p>

                            <p align="left">Steamhubs is a steam community redesign and re-imagining of how players can interact with a game community. Currently, game communities are segmented across multiple social media sites: Raptr, Neogaf, Sub-Reddits, and Tumblr. Steamhubs aims to provide a minimalistic and delightful user experience to be the one stop shop for consuming gaming media </p>

                            <h3 align="left">Primary Persona</h3>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/steam1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <br>

                            <p align="left">With Benjie Button, we have our primary persona who needs to fill in a social gap in his gaming. With SteamHubs, the <b> goal </b> is to give users like Benjie an engaging experience.</p>

                            <p align="left">Success would involve a cleaner experience measured by user feedback. For a business, metrics such as session time, and increased number of posts in the steam community would be important to look at. Other metrics could include increased buy conversion on games that can be correlated with steam game hub visits, or increased social activity among users and their friends. </p>

                            <h3 align="left">Task Analysis</h3>
                            <br>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/steam2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <br>

                            <p align="left">To fully flesh-out SteamHubs, an analysis of what kind of tasks users need to perform day to day was created to determine what to prioritize during interface design. The idea is for the user to be able to find games easily, and comment with other communities in the least amount of steps possible. Once a user finds a game in step 1.0 - steps 2.0 - 4.0 can be reached from a central space and allow a user to keep interacting with community content. For example, if a user wanted to comment on a forum post, and then talk to a friend within the same session, they should be able to do that in whatever order they choose. For that reason, steps 2.0 - 4.0 are interchangeable, and additional steps such looking at game art or videos can be added in between. What this results in is a central hub for the user to be able to perform their community interactions. </p>

                            <h3 align="left">Wireframes</h3>
                            <br>

                             <figure><img src="img/portfolio/steam3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><figcaption> SteamHubs Wireframes</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <br>

                            <p align="left">Above are wireframes developed with central community hub in mind from the task analysis. The idea is that players who go to SteamHubs want to check on communities periodically when they are away from gaming. Every game portrait shall link to a central game hub, and buttons to interact with content should have a clear call to action.  </p>

                            <h3 align="left">Layout</h3>

                            <p align="left">The first screen that a user sees after the launch page is the home page which contains the linked player profile from Steam. Here they can see all of the games they recently played along with access to other tabs to find other games. Recently played games are at the forefront due to a user more likely to have interest in a game that they are currently playing.  </p>

                            <p align="left">For the majority of the mobile design, an emphasis on showing less information to the user while also allowing them to navigate with familiar cues was prioritized. Each screen contains a header containing screen information. Content goes below the header, and dividing lines should separate content whether it is a colour change or line itself. Visuals will be talked about further after navigation. </p>

                            <p align="left">Content pages should include fewer than 5 posts per page. The goal is to have the screens readable, versus having the user bombarded with information to keep the minimalistic style. An example of the simple post layout is shown below with a maximum of 4 options:</p> 

                            <br>

                             <figure><img src="img/portfolio/steam35.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><figcaption> User Additional Menu</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <br>

                            <h3 align="left">Navigation</h3>

                            <p align="left">For navigation, a user should always understand that images are all clickable. Whether it is game art taking a user to a game hub, or a profile picture pushing them to a friend profile page, this is crucial to the SteamHubs experience. Exceptions to the rule involve video or art posts in a game hub, however it should be clear that clicking these leads you to more details about the post. </p>

                            <p align="left">Secondly, a header specific to a game hub allows a user to separate the discover screens from game community screens. When a user is in a game hub, they understand they can always go back one screen with a back arrow on the left of the header. </p>

                            <h3 align="left">User Testing</h3>

                            <p align="left">A design walkthrough using Marvel was run through with 3 participants during a interface design workshop class at the University of Waterloo. The main question and task for the participants was “Comment on a discussion post for a game”. One user mentioned that there was not enough actions available for discussions, such as reply count, and messaging options when replying to a post. All three were able to navigate successfully to the post without external difficulty. Further testing is required once the SteamHubs is fully complete with tools such as A/B Testing once a conversion funnel is created or user surveys. </p>


                            <h3 align="left">Visuals</h3>

                            <p align="left">For the visual branding, SteamHubs wants to brand itself as modern and clean to attract new steam users. Minimalistic use of colour, along with strong separation of sections through colour provide eye catching flair. Colours are also linked to navigation for certain calls to action. The palette chosen, composing of white, orange, grey and various shades of teal enable a strong contrast between sections. See the visuals applied across multiple screens below: </p>

                            <br>

                            <figure><img src="img/portfolio/steam4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><figcaption> SteamHubs Overview</figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <br>

                            <h3 align="left">Conclusions and Learnings</h3>

                            <p align="left">SteamHubs still has sections to be complete such as game streams, game videos, and games mentions, but the base navigation, layout, and colours are there as a strong foundation for future development. Additional thought towards user settings pages should be taken to into account along with on-boarding should be developed next. </p>

                            <p align="left">As this was the first interface design for mobile project I have done, I found process helps greatly in developing and improving an idea. Understanding your goals and tasks before delving into layout and navigation is extremely crucial to having a better understanding of what you want to build. This will save time and allow a designer to iterate faster without being held back by a goal that hasn’t been fully fleshed out.</p>

                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <strong text-align="left">Skills:</strong><p> Typography, Logo Design</p>
                            <b align="left">Tools:</b><p> Sketch</p>
                             
                            <h3 align="left">A Brief Project Background</h3>

                            <p align="left"> I was playing around with Sketch in February when I remembered I was tasked (I probably volunteered) with creating the team logo back in the Fall term. Clearly, it was not a high priority, then, but with engineering symposium lurking around the corner, I thought it would be a good idea to start designing something that represents what we’ve been working on for the past 6 months.    </p>

                            <p align="left">  My fourth year design project is on the topic of container shipping. Specifically, optimizing scanner placements in ports on containers around the world that get sent to the United States. The idea is that goods are scanned before they enter the country, and prevent a situation not alike that of the Trojan Horse used to enter Troy by the Greeks. We call ourselves <b>Team Equus</b> which is latin for ‘horse’.    </p>
                            
                            <h3 align="left">The Logo Design Process</h3>

                            <p align="left"> Even though it is a heavy research intensive project - images of the sea, and ships come to mind. When you think security - you think robust and stable.    </p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/equus1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p align="left"> The colour palette above exemplifies both imagery of the deep sea, as well as stability. The colour chosen was taken using the last colour and adding red and blue hues. I wanted a colour that also was not just muted, but have presence.    </p>

                            <p align="left"> In pictures of older ships, you will see the names of ships printed on both simple, and complex fonts. For the logo, we wanted something that represented nautical fonts, but also feel modern. My choice of Heiti I feel reflects that.     </p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/equus2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p align="left"> Now onto the main design. Good logo design involves simplicity, and familiarity. In addition - it helps the viewer peak into what a company or work is about. When I first started thinking about my project, I knew ships was the  first image I thought of. Could I make an outline of a ship that is easy to understand?   </p>

                            <p align="left"> I started drawing outlines of ships on paper and drew something that I thought could represent a ship easily:  </p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/equus25.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                             <p align="left"> I put it into sketch using vector art while exaggerating features such as the sails. However something about it was off. Our project involves optimizing shipping containers.   </p>

                             <img src="img/portfolio/equus3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                             <p align="left"> With this idea in mind, I thought about how we could incorporate that into the logo. Add containers on the top of the ship? Show a map of earth with routes pointing everywhere? But then I remembered our story about our team name, and how it derives from latin for horse.   </p>

                             <img src="img/portfolio/equus4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                             <p align="left"> This was perfect. A horse on top of a ship is a great representation of the invasion of Troy. Except - it looks more like a unicorn. I decided to finetune the logo a bit more and add details such as hair and mane to make the image look more realistic and professional. This was based off of an outline I saw online.  </p>

                             <img src="img/portfolio/equus5.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                             <p align="left"> There! A little vector arting there, a little asymetric bending here and hah! A double entendre on trojan horse, ships and a good representation of our fourth year design project. Our team logo.   </p>

                            <p align="left">Armo was a third year design project where we built the best haptic feedback device for your arm in virtual reality (VR). We thought it would be cool to build something that interfaces with VR, and thought that there was a need for more physical immersion. The device attaches to your elbow and sends a signal to a mechanical disc to stop your arm from moving.</p>

                            </figure>

                            <p align="left">To test our theory and practical application of our project - we had to do some user research. </p>

                            <h3 align="left">Wizard of Oz</h3>

                            <p align="left">The Wizard of Oz is a technique where the researcher simulates system responses from behind the scenes and the participant interacts with the system that appears to be real[1]. Participants or users in this case are led to believe there are interacting with a fully functioning prototype, however this is not the case. The goal is to allow a user to experience a proposed product before anything costly is built - in our case a physical prototype itself.

                            For our case, it was extremely easy to set up. Users are so engrossed in virtual reality that they are unable to pay attention to their surroundings. Lastly, we wanted to have strong positive sentiment that haptic feedback did indeed add to the immersion. </p>

                            <h3 align="left">The Setup</h3>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/armo1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p align="left">Participants were told that the google cardboard they were using had a surprise feature of offering full immersion. I asked them to try three different virtual simulations: Walking through an old Victorian room, riding a roller coaster and walking through a cave.  Each of them will be utilizing the Mattel Viewmaster, which is a Google Cardboard certified device providing entry level virtual reality to the participants. While the participants go through the simulations, Garrett Hardy will be involved during the roller coaster and cave scenes as the system response (This is close to simulation, however I still directed Garrett as the users went through each scenario). </p>

                            <p align="left"> <b>Scenario 1: </b> For the first test, users were places in a Victorian Room. Their main task was to touch the chair depicted in the first scene. A stool was used to replicate the chair. </p>

                            <p align="left"> <b>Scenario 2: </b> The Google Rollercoaster VR application was the setting for the second test. To simulate a railing, a relative poor choice at the time was to use a subject's arm. In the future, a metallic pole object should be used. </p>

                            <p align="left"> <b>Scenario 3: </b> The last scenario involved a user venturing forth in a cave. Similar to the last scenario, a human body was used to replicate the haptic feedback of the cavewalls. </p>



                            <h3 align="left">Results</h3>

                            <p align="left"> After each virtual scenario, users were asked about how they felt about the experience. I recorded their statements and their overall feeling about each experience. Below is an example capture of the results:</p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/armo4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p align="left">Out of the three simulations, it looked like having a real chair for users to touch was a positive thing. For the roller coaster and cave, the overall sentiment was either neutral or negative. This can be attributed to poor use of props, and the fact that using a human as the system response would have raised some red flags within the user. Both the railing and cave walls do not have a 1 to 1 material match with users. </p>

                            <p align="left"> For a user to feel fully immersed, we must ensure the correct amount of pressure is being provided to a users arm. Too much and the user will have dissonance between the object they are seeing and the feedback.
                            In addition, users should be able to use the device as a natural extension of themselves, and not require external input with the exception of their arm.</p>

                            <p align="left">Another interesting observation is that users do not know where they are in the physical space when moving around the virtual simulations. Potentially our prototype can have a sensor that tells the user where they are with respect to reality in order to help their orientation. One pitfall is that with the Mattel Viewmaster is that users always had to have one hand on the headset. In real life, people are not handicapped this way and a potential loss of both immersion and behaviour should be noted.</p>

                            <p align="left"> Lastly, users like to utilize their hands and fingers when they are looking around. This was out of the scope of the project and should be something to consider in the future. </p>

                            <h3 align="left">Learnings and Improvements</h3>

                            <p align="left"> The system response should basically be almost perfect similar to what the final prototype or product should function. Otherwise, users will sense the system response isn’t real and that takes them out of the immersion, as seen from the sentiment in the cave and roller coaster scenarios. </p>

                            <ul>
                            	<li>Have better system responses ready to go. Replace Garrett with real world objects from the simulation</li>
                            	<li>Since the product right was in its current stage as an arm exoskeleton,  provide that as a sleeve wearable</li>
                            	<li>Go through multiple iterations with new users to gather more data and make stronger conclusions</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p align="left"> All in all - doing Wizard of Oz was an interesting way to validate haptic feedback in VR. For future projects, using Wizard of Oz is a great cost effective way of doing user testing before even having your first initial prototype.

                            In addition, a set of user requirements early on can also be created with this method. Seeing what doesn't work can enable a designer to avoid those pitfalls. </p>

                            <h3 align="left">Background</h3>
                            <p align="left">Foosbot was a chatbot co-designed during my internship with Michael Shimokura (I miss you!) at Kik Messenger in the Fall of 2015.  </p>

                            


                            <h3 align="left">Problem</h3>
                            <p align="left">At Kik, Foosball was one of the unifying games among interns and employees during work breaks. Sometimes, however, due to the varying working schedules of each individual, we found that we did not know who was free to play foosball without distracting other employees.   </p>

                            <h3 align="left">An Experiment with Chatbots</h3>
                            <p align="left">Chatbots are bots that you can chat with which will reply back with pre-determined responses based on your input, or if backed by an artificial intelligence engine, reply to contextually. As messaging is the main interface for communicating with employees in real time, it would make sense to reach out to the same people using the same medium. As a result Foosbot was born.   </p>

                            <p align="left">You can chat with a bot using typed responses, but what’s really unique about Kik when we first released chatbots was the ability to have the user click on pre-determined responses that send immediately. As interns, we were lucky enough to be the first to play with and research how users can interact with chat before the feature fully released to the public. </p>

                            <h3 align="left">Hello Foosbot</h3>

                            <p align="left">Foosbot was our prototype for enabling employees to find other people who also wanted to play foosball without distracting others.</p>

                            <figure><img src="img/portfolio/foos1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><figcaption> Foosbot Kik Profile </figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <br>

                            <p align="left">We thought about what was important for a Foosball chatbot and finding people. In our initial brainstorming, we thought 2v2 was the most fun match up type, so for the initial prototype we designed around getting 2v2 match up going. A queuing system needed to be built, along with a leaderboard to gamify our bot for the extra incentive to make players get better. </p>

                            <h3 align="left">Emoji Interface</h3>

                            <p align="left">We thought having words as pre-determined buttons took too much space and was not a good interface for a queuing application. Instead, as young interns we thought using emojis conveying simple actions would be a much better and useful idea. Emoji's are used at a much higher rate for teenagers than other older demographics. [1] </p>


                            <p align="left">A soccer ball or play button could indicate a start of the queue, or emoji happy faces could even represent a rating system on how well a user thought the game was going. Lastly, because emoji's are a universal standard across different platforms, using their unicode once applies their design everywhere. There are slight differences in the visual design of emojis between iOS and Android. </p>

                            <p align="left">In the end we ended up with these emojis for our interface:</p>

                            </figure>

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            <figure><img src="img/portfolio/foos35.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><figcaption> State 3 Interface (iOS, Android) </figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            <p align="left">There are basically 3 different states a user can be in with respect to our emoji interface.</p>

                            <p align="left"><b>State 1:</b> Queue or Check Leaderboard</p>

                            <p align="left">A soccer ball allows you to enter the queue. Top allows a user to view the leaderboard. A question mark allows the user to determine who is in the queue. A cancel emoji indicates cancel. </p>


                            <p align="left"><b>State 2:</b> Cancel Queue or Check Queue or Check Leaderboard </p>

                            <p align="left">Once a user is in the queue, they can either leave or check the leaderboard for their own pleasure. It was decided only one action should bring the user back out of the state, and it will always bring them back to state 1. </p>

                            <p align="left"><b>State 3:</b> We Won or We Lost or Cancel Game</p>

                            <p align="left">Once four people are in the queue, the bot responds with draw probability based on the users' previous rank. If they are unranked, a default skill of 25 is used (Microsoft's TrueSkill Algorithm) for it's calculation.  </p>

                            <p align="left">Below is a sample of entering a queue and exiting the queue: </p>

                            <figure><img src="img/portfolio/foos4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><figcaption> Queue Response Examples </figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            <p align="left">If the bot does not recognize input sent by the user, it responds with a confused emoji and gives the user pre determined emoji confused face in chat. This message should be changed to be text based because it was  a confusing error message to our initial users. </p>

                            <figure><img src="img/portfolio/foos5.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><figcaption> User Opting for Leaderboard </figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <br/>
                            <br/>


                            <figure><img src="img/portfolio/foos6.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""><figcaption> Leaderboard </figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <br/>
                            <br/>

                            <p align="left">Finally the leaderboard is displayed above. The TrueSkill rating is there to encourage people to play and compete playfully with each other in the office.  </p>


                            <h3 align="left">Improvements and Closing Thoughts</h3>

                            <p align="left">Having a legend of emoji to action can help the user navigate our interface without needing to click the responses and seeing how the bot reacts. With our sample size of around 25 users, none have reported issues navigating or queuing for foosball and have continued to compete to become the best Kik Foosball player. </p>

                            <p align="left">By doing formal user testing such as an SUS survey given at the end, or doing user interviews, more issues relating to navigation can rise up to the top. Considering the simplicity of the interface and development time, it was determined that this would be the next step to bring the chatbot to the masses.  </p>

                            <p>I wrote an inspirational blog post that garnered 10,000+ views and a 60% read through rate from one facebook share. It was extremely scary letting out this piece into the world, uncertain whether people would feel inspired. Many people reached out who went through similar ordeals and were grateful they were not alone. This was a catalyst in my increasing passion for helping other people, and grow even more as an individual.  </p>

                            <p>We were tied for the best mark on the design of a cardboard bridge in a class of 87 engineering students. An all nighter was pulled in order to make this project work, and it was so worth it. Lifetime friendships were forged that night and we learned how to build strong cardboard bridges.</p>
